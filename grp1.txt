             *#RaceTheLimits*
 📬 Greetings from the Team!! 
Hello Sir/Madam
Hope you are having a good day! 
My self Nidhey Bhangale, Finance Subordinate of the Team Turbocrafters for season 2021-22. I got your contact from our Professor Mr. Pradip Patil.

*Team Turbocrafters* is in it's astounding 8️⃣th year of building rough & tough All-Terrain Vehicle to represent S.I.E.S. Graduate School of Technology at National level competitions like BAJA SAE INDIA, MEGA ATV, ATVC, etc. This year, the highlight event i.e., BAJA SAEINDIA has been divided into 3 Phases. The tireless efforts made by our team members has made it possible for us to successfully complete the first phase of the competition. Presently, we spend sleepless nights in a race against the clock to complete the manufacturing of our 2023 model.....⏳

Our vehicle has been designed to overcome a variety of obstacles, but the of lack of funds is one which will require helping hands to push the vehicle through (((✋🤚)))

📄We are reaching out to industry professionals beginning from our own Alumni in search of contacts of such individuals who can sponsor the team 🗒️✅

✒️ We write to you in anticipation that you can please spare us some time and share contacts from your side to help the team overcome this hurdle 📔📞

🏆 Previously for the first time in India and the history of Team Turbocrafters, we made a a 4 Wheel Drive. This year we have improved our design for better results. The 4WD design has increased the number of components and their complexity. This has also led to increase in our budget 📈

🔊 To cope with this demand of funds, we have launched our crowdfunding campaign on Ketto.org

[25/11/22, 12:17:58] Kedar Wakade (dy ): Hello Active Learners!

_*"Doing an internship is much more hands-on than you might learn at university. You actually get to experience the job, rather than learn about it in the classroom, and you are presented with real responsibilities."*_

_We invite all the learning enthusiasts to become a part of this Winter Internship Program that will help you in gaining knowledge in the discipline of_ *CYBERSECURITY*

A solid cybersecurity plan can offer a good security posture against malicious assaults intended to gain access to, alter, delete, destroy, or extort sensitive data and systems belonging to a business or user. Security measures are essential in preventing such attacks.

_This internship program will provide three weeks of hands-on training on_
1) Introduction to Cyber Security.
2) Kali Linux Tools.
3) Concepts on Ethical Hacking.
4) Implementation of Cloud Security.

Also during this programme, participants will learn about handling malware threats, ethical hacking guidelines, vulnerability analysis ideas, and cryptography in detail.

The internship will be conducted in a *hybrid mode* – a few sessions will be conducted both offline and online, students who can visit the college are welcome to experience the offline sessions.

• Followed by the 3 weeks of training, participants will work on *interesting projects* under the guidance of mentors. 
• *Exciting Cash prizes* shall be awarded to the best projects.
• *A Certificate of participation* will be provided after the successful completion of the project.

*DATE*: 12th December 2022 to 7th January 2023

As we celebrate our 9th year, we look back at the countless shutter clicks that have immortalized our experiences, friendships, and the essence of life itself. 🌇

Here’s to 9 years of creativity, growth, and the boundless magic of the lens. 🌟🎂

*9 YEARS OF CAPTURING MEMORIES OF RAIT📸🌇*

Photography is not just about images; it’s about emotions, stories, and connections. For 9 years, our *PCR*  has been doing just that—capturing hearts through the lens. 
Each click has been an expression of our passions, and each frame has held a piece of our souls. ❤️✨
Today, we stand on the threshold of a new chapter, but we carry with us the memories, the art, and the love we’ve shared over the past 9 years. 
Here’s to framing more hearts, telling more stories, and celebrating our journey. 🌠📷

[11/09/23, 18:13:44] Ansh (dy ): design and configure a web application to connect to database instance with ec2 and access the web application using
[11/09/23, 18:15:53] Asad (dy ): Creating a web application on an EC2 instance that connects to a database instance and accessing it using the EC2 public IP involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Set up an AWS Account:
If you don't already have an AWS account, sign up for one at https://aws.amazon.com/. You'll need this account to create EC2 instances and database instances.

Launch an EC2 Instance:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 service.
Click on "Launch Instance" to create a new EC2 instance.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your web application's technology stack (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
Select an instance type based on your resource requirements.
Configure the instance details, including the network and subnet settings.
Add storage as needed.
Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic to your EC2 instance (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and the database port).
Review and launch the instance.
Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Once your EC2 instance is running, you can connect to it using SSH. You can do this using the terminal on your local machine or tools like PuTTY if you're using Windows.
Install Required Software:

Install the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), application runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP), and any other dependencies needed for your web application.
Configure the web server to serve your application.
Set Up the Database:

You can either use Amazon RDS to create a managed database instance or set up a database directly on another EC2 instance.
Make sure the database is properly configured and accessible from your EC2 instance. Configure security groups to allow traffic from the EC2 instance's security group.
Configure Your Web Application:

Update your web application's configuration to use the database connection details (e.g., hostname, port, username, password).
Ensure that your application code connects to the database properly using these configuration settings.
Test the Connection:

Test your web application to verify that it can connect to the database successfully. You can do this by accessing your web application from the EC2 instance itself.
Security and Firewall Settings:

Configure your security groups to allow incoming traffic on the ports your web application and database use.
Restrict access to your EC2 instance and database by IP address if necessary.
Accessing the Application via EC2 Public IP:

Find the public IP address of your EC2 instance in the AWS Management Console.
Use a web browser to access your web application by entering the EC2 instance's public IP address.
Domain Configuration (Optional):

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the EC2 public IP, you'll need to configure DNS settings and possibly set up an Elastic IP or use a load balancer for the EC2 instance.
Backup and Monitoring (Recommended):

Set up regular backups for your database.
Implement monitoring and alerting to keep an eye on the health of your EC2 instance and database.
Scaling (Optional):

If your application experiences increased traffic, consider auto-scaling or adding more resources to your EC2 instance and database to handle the load.

* गुरुर्ब्रह्मा ग्रुरुर्विष्णुः गुरुर्देवो महेश्वरः। गुरुः साक्षात् परं ब्रह्म तस्मै श्री गुरवे नमः॥*

We the PCR are really obliged to have such wonderful teachers in our life. Teachers plant the seeds of knowledge that grow forever. 
In RAIT teachers not only shape our future but also teach us beyond the classroom which are of great importance in our life. Their wonderful guidance and wisdom have been invaluable for all the students. ✨📖

Here are some of the glimpses of How we celebrated the heroes who ignite curiosity and fuel knowledge.
